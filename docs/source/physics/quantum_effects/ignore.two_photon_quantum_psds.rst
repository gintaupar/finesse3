Quantum noise calculated with the two-photon formalism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Explain how quantum noise can be calculated with :class:`.FrequencyResponse3` and :class:`.FrequencyResponse4`. Explain signal referring and how to calculate frequency dependent and independent squeezing at the same time. Explain and caution loss sources and HOMs. Show that this gives the same answers as :class:`.QuantumNoiseDetector` in the cases where the latter applies.
