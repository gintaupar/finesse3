    API
        Application programming interface. In computing, this term generally refers to
        interfaces that bridge one computing domain to another. When used in relation to
        |Finesse|, this typically refers to the Python API, which is the mechanism by
        which users interact with |Finesse| via Python by creating classes, making calls
        to functions, and otherwise using the |Finesse| library.

    model
        The Python object that contains the elements that represent some optical setup:
        components and detectors, and the connections between them. Alternatively, the
        kat-script that defines the model may sometimes also be referred to as a model,
        but strictly this is just a set of instructions to define a model.
