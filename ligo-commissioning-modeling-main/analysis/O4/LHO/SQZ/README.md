# LHO Squeezing models

This mostly adds the SQZ path to the finesse model and attempts to model beam profiles, OMC mode scans, quantum noise etc. to understand SQZ mode matching. Other models are also analyzed for comparison.

Lee's wield model from

Keita's alamode model is in the alamode directory here.
